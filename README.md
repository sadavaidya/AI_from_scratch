# AI and ML Algorithms from Scratch 📘💡

This repository is a collection of foundational AI and Machine Learning algorithms implemented **entirely from scratch** in Python. Each folder focuses on one algorithm or model (e.g., GPT, decision trees, gradient descent, etc.), often starting from theoretical principles and building toward a working implementation.

## 🎯 Motivation
- Gain **deep understanding** of ML/AI models by re-implementing them from the ground up.
- Showcase the ability to translate **research concepts into working code**.
- Build a **reference library** for interviews, research, and production prototyping.

## 💼 Industry Relevance
- Encourages practical understanding of model internals.
- Promotes writing **well-documented, modular, and readable code**.
- Useful for roles in **ML research, prototyping, or AI consulting** where understanding beyond libraries is valuable.

## 📁 Structure
Each folder contains:
- `README.md`: Brief explanation of that model.
- `*.ipynb` or `*.py`: The implementation and training/testing code.
- Optional notes, references, or visuals where helpful.

Stay tuned as more models and learning algorithms are added over time!
