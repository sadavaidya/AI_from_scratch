# GPT Decoder from Scratch 🧠⚙️

This implementation demonstrates a simplified GPT decoder model built entirely from scratch using PyTorch. It walks through core transformer building blocks such as self-attention, positional embeddings, and masked attention to generate Shakespeare-like text.

The code is intended for educational purposes and demonstrates how the GPT architecture works under the hood — without relying on any high-level libraries.
